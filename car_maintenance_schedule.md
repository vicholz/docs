# Basic Car Maintenance Schedule

This schedule provides a general guideline but should not replace specific advice from your vehicle manufacturer or mechanic. Always keep records of your maintenance to track and ensure timely servicing. For exact fluid types and capacities, refer to your vehicle's manual as these can differ greatly between makes and models.

## Daily Checks
- **Visual Inspection:** Quick look under the hood and around the vehicle for leaks or damage.
- **Check Tire Pressure:** Visually inspect and check nails/adjust to recommended PSI if tires look low. **Find PSI:** Usually on a sticker inside the driver's door jamb, in the glove compartment, or in the owner's manual.

## Weekly
- **Check Fluid Levels:** 
  - **Engine Oil:** Check the dipstick. **Capacity:** Manual or dipstick.
  - **Coolant:** Reservoir often near the radiator. **DO NOT OPEN/REMOVE RADIATOR CAP WHEN ENGINE IS HOT**

## Monthly
- **Check Fluid Levels:**
  - **Transmission Fluid:** Dipstick location varies - See owners manual. **Capacity:** Manual or dipstick.
  - **Brake Fluid:** Reservoir usually near the master cylinder. **Capacity:** Owner's manual.
  - **Power Steering Fluid:** Reservoir often near the front of the engine. **Capacity:** Manual or reservoir cap. **NOTE:** many new cars have electronic power steering which does not have fluid.
- **Lights and Indicators:** Test all lights (headlights, brake lights, turn signals).

## Every 3-6 Months or 3,000-6,000 Miles (whichever comes first)

## Note:
